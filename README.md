* **Driver Standings:** Updated standings during the race.
* **Weather Conditions:** Real-time weather data affecting the race.
* **Pit Stop Information:** Details of pit stops as they occur.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Charts and graphs to analyze race data.

## Features (Planned/In Development)

* **Live Data Fetching:** Implementation of reliable and efficient data sources.
* **Data Processing and Storage:** Handling and organizing real-time data.
* **Frontend Development:** Building a user-friendly and responsive interface.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating informative and engaging visualizations using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.
* **Historical Data Analysis:** Potentially incorporating past race data mainly for comparison.
* **User Customization:** Allowing users to personalize the dashboard.

## Technology Stack
